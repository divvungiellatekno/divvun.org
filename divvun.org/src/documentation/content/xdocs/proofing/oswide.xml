      <section>
         <title>Windows</title>

         <p>System wide spellers for Windows are available as part of the
         tools installed via the
         <a href="https://pahkat.uit.no/artifacts/divvun-installer_2.0.2_windows.exe">Divvun
         Installer</a>.</p>

         <p><strong>Enabling:</strong> Go to
         <strong>Settings > Devices > Typing</strong>, and turn on
         <strong>Highlight misspelled words</strong>. Further details can be
         found e.g.
         <a href="https://dottech.org/204923/turn-onoff-spell-checking-in-windows-10/">here</a>.
         Remember that you also need to enable a keyboard for the language you
         intend to type in.
         </p>

         <p><strong>Usage:</strong> Just switch to the keyboard/language you want to
         type in, and the speller will automatically be triggered.</p>

         <title>macOS</title>
         <p>System wide spellers for macOS are available as part of the
         tools installed via the
         <a href="https://pahkat.uit.no/artifacts/divvun-installer_2.0.1_macos.pkg">Divvun
         Installer</a>.</p>

         <p>To verify that
         the speller is working, open <strong>System Preferences > Keyboard >
         Text</strong>, and verify that your language is listed in the menu
         <strong>Spelling</strong> with <strong>«(MacDivvun)»</strong>
         after the language name. If not, restart your computer.</p>

         <p><strong>Usage:</strong> In applications using the system spelling
         checker services (most apps), just open the spelling checker dialog
         (<strong>Edit > Spelling and Grammar > Show Spelling and Grammar</strong>), and select
         your language in the language menu. If you always want to spell check
         in this language, you can make it the default spell checking language
         in System Preferences.</p>

         <title>Linux</title>

         <p>OS-wide spellers for Linux have to be built from source, but most of
         the required packages are available as standard, or easily installable
         for the various distributions. Further instructions can be found <a
         href="https://giellalt.uit.no/infra/GettingStartedOnLinux.html">here</a>,
         together with links to source tarballs for the supported languages.</p>
