            <p>Sorry, no support - YET. This should in principle be possible
            since Windows 8. It requires a system-wite speller. We are working
            on it, but it has turned out to be harder than anticipated. We'll
            update the page as soon as we have news.</p>

         <title>Chrome</title>
            <p>Sorry - no support. Chrome uses Google's own spelling checker,
            which we don't have access to. And Google does not support the
            languages we are working on (please proove us wrong, Google!).</p>

         <title>Safari</title>
            <p>Safari uses the OS-wide spelling service in OSX. See the download
            options on the page for <a href="">OS-wide spelling checkers</a>.</p>

         <title>Firefox</title>
            <p>There are actually two sets of Firefox spelling plugins, one
            made by Tino Didriksen, and another built using <a href="">Mozvoikko</a>. The
            language coverage is different for the two, with some overlap.</p>
