# In the __Variant:__ drop-down menu select the
  target language layout:\\

# Edit the label (used in the KDE environment to signal which keyboard layout
  is active), and press __OK__:\\

# If you forgot to change the label, you can still change it in the main
  keyboard settings window:\\

# Finally, if you want to have a keyboard shortcut to easily switch between
  keyboard layouts, switch to the __Advanced__ tab, and enable the preferred
  keyboard shortcut:\\

# When done, the keyboard layout label is visible in the bottom tray; the full
  name is visible when hovering over the label:\\

# Switch layout by clicking on the label or using the keyboard shortcut.
