         <title>About the Divvun tools</title>
         <p>The Divvun tools have been developed during two three year long projects. The proofing tools are available
         for the most popular office suites on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux. The <a
         href="http://www.sametinget.no/">Norwegian Saami Parliament</a>, the <a
         href="http://www.regjeringen.no/en/dep/fad.html?id=339">Ministry of Government administration, Reform and
         Church affairs</a> and the <a href="http://www.regjeringen.no/en/dep/kd.html?id=586">Ministry of Research</a>
         have funded these projects.</p>
         <p>Divvun I (Northern and Lule Saami) lasted from 2004 to 2007, and Divvun II (Southern Saami) from 2008 to 2010.
         From 2011 and onwards the project will be under the administration of developing Saami language technology and
         practical tools based on language technology in cooperation with the <a href="http://giellatekno.uit.no">Center for Saami language technology</a>.</p>
