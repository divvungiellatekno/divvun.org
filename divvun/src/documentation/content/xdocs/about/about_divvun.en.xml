         <title>About the Divvun tools</title>
         <p>The Divvun tools have been developed during two three year long projects. The proofing tools are available
         for the most popular office suites on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux. The <a
         href="http://www.sametinget.no/">Norwegian Sámi Parliament</a>, the <a
         href="http://www.regjeringen.no/en/dep/fad.html?id=339">Ministry of Government administration, Reform and
         Church affairs</a> and the <a href="http://www.regjeringen.no/en/dep/kd.html?id=586">Ministry of Research</a>
         have funded these projects.</p>
         <p>Divvun I (Northern and Lule Sámi) lasted from 2004 to 2007, and Divvun II (Southern Sámi) from 2008 to 2010.
         From 2011 and onwards the project will be under the administration of developing Sámi language technology and
         practical tools based on language technology in cooperation with the <a href="http://giellatekno.uit.no">Center for Sámi language technology</a>. Divvun is financed by the Norwegian Ministry for regions and modernisation (KMD).</p>
