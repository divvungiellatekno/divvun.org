!!!Since last time

!!Polderland

* some mishaps in command line hyphenator
** (unexpected code incompatibilities with cmd line speller)
** starightened it out. Almost finished now - expect to drop today
* inDesign spellers work and return suggestions
** some more work needed on custom dictionaries
** (to assure InDesign behaviour in stead of Word behaviour)
* bug found by Microsoft in all office 12 spellers,
** needs to be fixed for Sami too:
** IF number of occurrences of same misspelled word AND
      marking recurring errors option is switched off AND
      1st misppelled word is changed to suggestion AND
      next misspelled word is added to custom dictionary
   THEN the correction is not recognized.
** has to do with order of handling several internal dictionaries.
* working on zip utility for windows installer: pending
* fixing bugs: some bugs pending
** 3/4/5-part compound appear to work in general,
   but not in some specific cases
*** have worked out details of a technical solution + costs (in hrs).
    Decision to be taken today/tomorrow 
* Speller behaviour: only suggests if errors are limited to 1 part of compound.
** undesired (or should be user setting),
** will be changed in future drop
* fixing bugs: some bugs pending
* new bug messages received but not inspected yet


!!Divvun

* Windows installer testing
* more PLX conversion fixes
* also working on OOo speller (using hunspell)

!!!Issue discussion

!!473 - Windows installer

Alternatives to solve it:
* make an executable installer file - requires InstallShield, meaning that
  either Polderland will have to make each installation package, or that the
  Divvun project will have to get an InstallShield license
* make self-extracting zip files for download, with autostart options of the
  extracted objects; some alternative zippers for this:


For both cases different types of protection software (firewalls, anti-virus,
etc) might block either download or execution of the installer. But default
InstallShield installers behave in the same (or a similar) way, so that should
not be any different.

!!Leopard

Mac OS X 10.5 (''Leopard'') has arrived, and we need to test the tools under
that OS as well.

!!!Schedule

* October 31: Hyphenator command line tool
* October 31: Hyphenation bug fix
* November 7: multipart compound fix (pending positive decision)
* November 15: Divvun code freeze
* November 15: Indesign speller
* December 11-13: public release (one of those days)


!!!Next meeting

Next week (6.11.) at 09.30 Dutch/Norwegian time.

!!!TODO:
* __PLD__ discuss limits in N-part compound functionality with mgmt team,
          get back to Divvun ASAP
* __PLD__ pass information on self-extracting ziptool with autostart option
          + instructions on how to use it (not in working order yet) - pending
* __PLD__ provide information on InDesign language grouping
* __PLD__ check: is mklex version G5 only, or universal binary? UB
* __PLD__ preferred order of results: see above
