!!!Bug status

!!Solved/cancelled

Nothing new since last time.

!!To be solved/investigated by Divvun
||Div ||Pld ||Description
| 621 | xxx | other hyphenator bugs. PB: not as much incorrect as well as weird-looking.
| 630 | xxx | Word (prefix) with hyphen is rejected - and suggested
| 652 | xxx | UPPERCASE-typos only get acronym-suggestions: VARI -> no sugg, vARI -> VÁRI as sugg; consequence of the sugg. mechanism, unresolvable
| 581 | xxx | consonant doubling => actual problem is suggestions with hyphens (split compound type); these can be blocked as suggestions, and thus be removed (they would still be recognised, though)

!!Under investigation by Polderland
||Div ||Pld ||Description
| 679 | xxx | Discretionary/soft hyphen not respected - repaired, repaired code to be dropped

!!!Priority list
 
# to be supplied before 2008-12-12 - Installer for Microsoft Office 2008 / Mac
# InDesign proofing tools for Windows - almost completed

!!!Next meeting

Next meeting (10.12.) at 10.00 Dutch/Norwegian time.
