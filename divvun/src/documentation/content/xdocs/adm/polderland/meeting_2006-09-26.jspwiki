* since last time

* questions and answers



!!Since last time

__Peter__ sent phonetic speller correction rules, and __Thomas__ has been
working on them.

__Binary__ version of the speller for Mac not yet available, the old version has
to be updated to be Unicode-compatible with Office 2004/Mac. It is in the works.

__Test results__: the regression testing didn't cope well with the rather large
data set (got into memory swapping:-( ), but it was tested with a smaller sample
(the test code will be rewritten to deal better with data in the 600+ Mb size).

Test findings upto now: all words tested are OK, except for:

{{{
- words containing colons (":"), such as
    "ABC-company:ai"
    "ABC-company:aid", ...
- words containing asterisk characters ("*"), such as
    "Juvvelan*gorsa" - this is a typo, the only one, it is already fixed
- multi-word expressions, such as
    "Beakka HÃ¡nno gieddila...":
}}}

!!Hyphenation

{{{
# = word boundary
^ = possible hyphenation point
- = hard hyphen
}}}

Hyphenation at Divvun has improved, but there are still issues. Will be
investigated.

!!!Tasks since last time
* send correction/phonetic rules to Thomas (__Peter__)
** done
* review the processed data sets (__Thomas__)
** no need to do this, as the delivered data isn't split any more.
* make speller lexicon data for Polderland, with POS, compounding properties and
  hyphenation (__Divvun__, mainly __Tomi__)
** started
* try to send a first binary to Sjur (__Peter__)
** we'll wait for the Mac version
* check whether hyphen is used when compounding abbreviations (TV-stuolla)
  (__Thomas__)
** yes, hyphen


!!!TODO:
* continue to improve hyphenation (__Sjur__ and __Thomas__)
* continue with speller data generation/conversion (__Tomi__)
