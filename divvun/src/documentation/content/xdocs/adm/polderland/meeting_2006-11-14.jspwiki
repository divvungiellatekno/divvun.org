!!!Meeting with Polderland 14.11.2006

Participants:
* Peter Beinema
* Sjur Moshagen



!!Agenda

* since last time
* questions and answers



!!Since last time

__Polderland:__

* generated new lexicon for north Sami, ready to roll out speller Alpha;
* creating new type of hyphenator (integrating speller in hyphenator)
* migrating lexicon generator + test kit to apple

__Divvun:__

* included and constrained the use of derivations - the generated data exploded
  to roughly 20 Gb:-)
* more work on the PLX data generator

__Next:__
* finishing the new hyphenation engine
* drop the next speller version (sme and smj), and the first hyphenator; this
  will be the official Alpha drop, and should be accompanied with an e-mail
  stating this.
* try to provide the first batch of PLX encoded data


!!Alpha version

!Spellers

Both {{sme}} and {{smj}}. The {{sme}} version will be using the latest, 20Gb
lexicon, if possible.

!Hyphenators

Will use only the limited data delivered to Polderland, and use the fallback
algorithm for all words not in the lexicon. It will provide a nice test case
for the fallback algorithm:-)


!!Possible issues

!Compounding

The section on compounding rules are specific to Dutch, but similar rules could
be made for SÃ¡mi as well, if needed. The Divvun project will try to make use of
the existing machinery before extensions are considered.


!!Next meeting

Next Tuesday (21.11.) at the usual time.

!!!TODO:
* continue to improve hyphenation (__Sjur__ and __Thomas__)
* continue with speller data generation/conversion (__Tomi__)
* get language codes to work with Mac Office 2004 (and check MacOffice 2007)
  (__Polderland__)
* provide the Divvun project with the PLX format specification (__Polderland__)
** done
* deliver Alpha versions (__Polderland__)
* try to find proper compiler version for Adobe Indesign (old version will
  probably do)
