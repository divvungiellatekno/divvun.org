!!!Since last time

!!Polderland
* windows Office proofing tools ready, except for installer
* NSIS installer solution alpha sent
** waiting for comments and installation texts
* InDesign CS4: have SDKs for MacIntosh and Windows and debug version CS4
** working on both versions
*** speller works on Windows + Mac, hyphenator nearly finished. There were
    some issues with changes in the user dictionary interface, but they
    were solved.

!!Divvun
* M&S - waiting for a response from Polderland
* repeated words needs to be accepted in some cases
** PB: existing PLD Repeated Word functionality: there is a compile-time
   determining whether repeated words are to be flagged or not.
   There is no functionality to suppress repeated word messages
   for certain words only. There are no plans to add this functionality
   either: 'clean' solution would require some reordering and quite a bit
   of work, and we can't spare the time currently.

!!!Bug status

!!Solved/cancelled

||Div ||Pld ||Description
| 603 | xxx | suffix is accepted in the middle of a word: as per design
| 613 | xxx | speller does not accept 'Ga' tagged word as 2nd part
| 679 | xxx | Discretionary/soft hyphen not respected - repaired, repaired code to be dropped

!!To be solved/investigated by Divvun
||Div ||Pld ||Description
| 621 | xxx | other hyphenator bugs. PB: not as much incorrect as well as weird-looking.
| 630 | xxx | Word (prefix) with hyphen is rejected - and suggested
| 652 | xxx | UPPERCASE-typos only get acronym-suggestions: VARI -> no sugg, vARI -> VÁRI as sugg; consequence of the sugg. mechanism, unresolvable
| 581 | xxx | consonant doubling => actual problem is suggestions with hyphens (split compound type); these can be blocked as suggestions, and thus be removed (they would still be recognised, though)
| 670 | xxx | __REGRESSION:__ hard hyphen replaced with soft, see [latest test results|http://www.divvun.no/doc/proof/hyph/testing/regression-pl-forrest-smj-20090105.html] - since this was fixed earlier, and the hyphenation binary has not changed since then, we should investigate this first to see if we produce illegal PLX entries.

!!Under investigation by Polderland
||Div ||Pld ||Description
| 581 | xxx | consonant doubling
| 595 | xxx | problem with prefix containing hyphens
| 670 | xxx | Hard hyphen replaced by soft hyphen. Regression? Check for v. 1.1

!!!Priority list

!!!Next meeting
