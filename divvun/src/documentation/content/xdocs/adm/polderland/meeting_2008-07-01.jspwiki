!!!Since last time

!!Polderland

* Re-started work on InDesign/windows - according to Frank
functionality is OK, except for 1 crashing bug that he hasn't been able to locate yet. Bug is related to user dictionary, which appears to behave differently under windows. NB: Frank has holiday coming up (next 3 weeks).
For Xcode and Windows other people can easily take over; for InDesign he is the only one with hands-on experience. All is documented and the development environments are available, but we expect the learning curve to be steep, so we will probably put indesign development on hold for 3 weeks.
* Will do Mac Office 2008 when SW from MS arrives (tick... - will E-mail MS again)
* OpenOffice: no developments
* re-use Polderland knowledge: have to discuss with Theo, who is on holiday until next week

!!Divvun
* clean-up after switch to svn
* no major work last week, many on vacation
