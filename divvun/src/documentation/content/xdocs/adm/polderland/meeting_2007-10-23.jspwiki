!!!Meeting with Polderland 23.10.2007

Participants:
* Peter Beinema
* Sjur Moshagen


!!!Agenda

* Since last time
* Possible issues
* Next meeting
* Todo items for the next meeting


!!!Since last time

!!Polderland

* fixing bugs: some bugs pending
* compounding behaviour:
** 3/4/5-part compound appear to work in general,
   but not in some specific cases
*** have worked out details of a technical solution + costs (in hrs).
    Decision to be taken next week 
* working on zip utility for windows installer: pending
* Speller behaviour: only suggests if errors are limited to 1 part of compound.
** undesired (or should be user setting),
** will be changed in future drop
* work has started on Indesign Spellers for North + Lule Sami
** speller starts to work, skeleton version recognises words
** now adding the real functionality; relativey straightforward 
* work on command line hyphenator for Mac still nearly completed.
** implemented as front end for existing & delivered hyphenators
* new bug messages received but not inspected yet


!!Divvun

* major work on hyphenator debugging, several bugs found relating to compounds
* major remaining bugs relate to limits in the PLX formalism:
** N-part compounds either overgenerate in a bad way, or severely undergenerate
*** severely limits functionality; according to Divvun not in spec.
*** should be fixed (maybe later than originally planned final drop)
* added iso-disk installer for CD burning

None since last meeting.

!To be solved in next drop
||Div ||Pld ||Description
| 473 | 452 | Windows installer does not autostart after download => discuss solutions
| 516 | 4?? | vista installation from zip fails => probably solved by self-extracting zip; not functioning yet 

!Under investigation by Polderland
||Div ||Pld ||Description
| 461 | 448 | Spelling errors with editing distance 1 from lexicalised words do not get correct suggestions => explanation not good enough, investigate more samples *** still investigating
| 522 | xxx | Strange compounding fenomena
| 528 | xxx | Acro words get upper-case case endings
| 533 | xxx | Office 2007 gives North SÃ¡mi suggs in context menu when language is Lule => Divvun will check with the ''Public beta 2''.
| 545 | xxx | Bad hyphenation in compounds - fence post errors?
| 546 | xxx | Other bad hyphenation, different hyphenation in manual and auto
| 553 | xxx | Uninstallation under Windows Vista fails

!To be investigated by Divvun/Users
||Div ||Pld ||Description
| 447 | 443 | Windows speller doesn't install on terminal server => SD IT guys will have a look once more

!!!Issue discussion

!!473 - Windows installer

Alternatives to solve it:
* make an executable installer file - requires InstallShield, meaning that
  either Polderland will have to make each installation package, or that the
  Divvun project will have to get an InstallShield license
* make self-extracting zip files for download, with autostart options of the
  extracted objects; some alternative zippers for this:


For both cases different types of protection software (firewalls, anti-virus,
etc) might block either download or execution of the installer. But default
InstallShield installers behave in the same (or a similar) way, so that should
not be any different.


!!!Rough schedule

* Mid September: planned final drop from Polderland
** did drop, new drops still expected: new Windows installer, etc
* November 1: Divvun code freeze
* November 15: Indesign speller
* December 11: public release


!!!Next meeting

Next week (30.10.) at 09.30 Dutch/Norwegian time.

!!!TODO:
* __PLD__ discuss limits in N-part compound functionality with mgmt team,
          get back to Divvun ASAP
* __PLD__ pass information on self-extracting ziptool with autostart option
          + instructions on how to use it (not in working order yet) - pending
* __PLD__ provide information on InDesign language grouping
* __PLD__ check: is mklex version G5 only, or universal binary?
* __Divvun__ check bug {{533}} with latest release
