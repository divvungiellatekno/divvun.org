!!Bug status

!Solved/cancelled

||Div ||Pld ||Description
| 447 | 443 | Windows speller doesn't install on terminal server => SD IT guys will have a look once more => they found it, it was wrong setup on the server
| 533 | xxx | Office 2007 gives North SÃ¡mi suggs in context menu when language is Lule => Divvun will check with the ''Public beta 2''. This behaviour is caused by Word, and nothing any of us can do something about

!To be solved in next drop
||Div ||Pld ||Description
| 473 | 452 | Windows installer does not autostart after download

| 461 | 448 | Spelling errors with editing distance 1 from lexicalised words do not get correct suggestions => explanation not good enough, investigate more samples *** still investigating, low priority
| 522 | xxx | Strange compounding fenomena
| 524 | xxx | Multi-part compounds not always accepted
| 528 | xxx | Acro words get upper-case case endings
| 545 | xxx | Bad hyphenation in compounds - fence post errors? There seems to be an error in the Polderland code
