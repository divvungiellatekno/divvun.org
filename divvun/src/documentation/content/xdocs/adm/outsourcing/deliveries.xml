      <title>Introduction</title>

      <p>The basic goal of the outsourcing is to create the following tools
      given the linguistic resources developed by the Divvun project team, and
      in cooperation with the team.</p>

      <table>
        <caption>Overview of outsourced items</caption>

        <tr>

    <section>
      <title>Adobe InDesign</title>

      <p>The Divvun project will outsource the integration of a sme hyphenator
      with Adobe InDesign CS 2 or later, and possibly the whole making of the
      hyphenator. In the latter case, the Divvun project will provide the
      language-specific algorithm, and of course be responsible for testing
      the linguistic correctness of the deliverables.</p>

      <p>The exact list of deliverables is:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>one set of binary hyphenation file(s) for hyphenation of North
        Sámi according to the hyphenation rules of North Sámi, using the
        hyphenation API found in InDesign CS2 and all versions thereafter
        released before October 1<sup>st</sup>, 2007.</li>

        <li>installation application to provide end users with a simple and
        automatized process of correctly installing the binary file(s). The
        installation package shall be provided in the following languages:<ul>
            <li>English and the following Nordic languages at no additional
            cost, provided they are readily available from the provider:
            Norwegian bokmål, Swedish and Finnish.</li>

            <li>North Sámi, and potentially some or all of the following
            Nordic languages if not readily available from the provider:
            Norwegian bokmål, Swedish and Finnish. These language versions are
            based on translations provided by the Divvun team.</li>
          </ul></li>

        <li>user documentation in English and the following Nordic languages
        as far as readily available by the provider: Norwegian bokmål, Swedish
        and Finnish.</li>

        <li>user documentation in North Sámi, and possibly in other Nordic
        languages if not readily available from the provider Norwegian bokmål,
        Swedish and Finnish. These language versions are based on translations
        provided by the Divvun team.</li>

        <li>All the above (binaries, user documentation, installation
        application) shall be provided for MacOS X 10.3.9 or later; they could
        also be provided for MS Windows XP SP 2 or later, depending on what
        will finally be ordered.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The assumption behind the first user documentation point is that the
      providers have similar or identical existing products, and thus existing
      user documentation to be translated. Any existing user documentation
      will be reviewed before being accepted.</p>

      <title>Microsoft Office</title>

      <p>The Divvun project will outsource the making and the integration of
      the proofing tools for MS Office, based on the computational linguistic
      models developed by the project.</p>

      <section>
        <title>For MS Windows</title>

        <p>The exact list of deliverables for MS Windows is:</p>

          correction using the CSAPI version 3 in MS Office 2000, MS Office XP
          and all MS Office versions released before October 1<sup>st</sup>,
          2007, running on MS Windows 2000 (all versions), MS Windows XP (all
          versions) and MS Windows Vista (all versions).</li>

          <li>one set of binary file(s) to provide Lule Sámi spelling
          correction using the CSAPI version 3 in MS Office 2000, MS Office XP
          and all MS Office versions released before October 1<sup>st</sup>,
          2007, running on MS Windows 2000 (all versions), MS Windows XP (all
          versions) and MS Windows Vista (all versions).</li>

          listed above. The installation package shall be provided in the

              Norwegian bokmål, Swedish and Finnish.</li>

              <li>North Sámi, and potentially some or all of the following
              Nordic languages if not readily available from the provider:

              are based on translations provided by the Divvun team.</li>

          <li>user documentation in English and the following Nordic languages
          as far as readily available by the provider: Norwegian bokmål,
          Swedish and Finnish.</li>

          languages if not readily available from the provider Norwegian
          bokmål, Swedish and Finnish. These language versions are based on

        the providers have similar or identical existing products, and thus
        existing user documentation to be translated. Any existing user
        documentation will be reviewed before being accepted.</p>
