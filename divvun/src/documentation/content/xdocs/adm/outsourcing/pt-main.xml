      <p>bla.--bla</p>

      <note>This criterion is motivated by the fact that
      most of the adult SÃ¡mi population has never learned to write their own
      language, and have great difficulties spelling it correctly. It is an
      explicit goal of the project to create spellers that will help this
      group, and if a provider does not have a framework for correcting and
      making suggestions for such spelling errors, much more work will have
      to be put into finding and studying these errors, and adding manual
      entries for correcting such errors.</note>
