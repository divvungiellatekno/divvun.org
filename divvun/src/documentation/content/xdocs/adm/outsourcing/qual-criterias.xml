      <title>Introduction</title>

      <p>The qualification criterias set the minimum requirements for any
      company to participate in the public tender. Failure of meeting these
      requirements automatically disqualifies any company from the
      competition.</p>

      <p>The qualification criterias are decided upon by the project
      board.</p>
