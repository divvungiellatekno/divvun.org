  target language layout:\\

# Finally, if you want to have a keyboard shortcut to easily switch between
  keyboard layouts, switch to the __Advanced__ tab, and enable the preferred
  keyboard shortcut:\\

# When done, the keyboard layout label is visible in the bottom tray; the full
  name is visible when hovering over the label:\\
