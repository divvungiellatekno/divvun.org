        <title>How the spellchecker is made</title>

	<p>The spellchecker is made in close cooperation with the <a
	href="http://giellatekno.uit.no">Sámi language technology
            project</a> at the <a href="http://uit.no/">University of Tromsø</a>. The Tromsø project has
	made programs that are able to both inflect and parse Sámi
	wordforms. This work is being used as basis for the Sámi
	spellcheckers.</p>

	<p>The programmers prepare a working environment for the
	linguists, so that they may survey texts in order to test
	coverage (the spellers' ability to recognise correctly spelled
	words) and generation. The linguists add words that are
	missing in the lexica, and adjust the grammar of the analyser
	In this way, the lexica and grammar are improved and enlarged
	on a continuous basis.</p>

	<p>Since the spellchecker shall be made for both Windows, Mac
	OS X and Linux, the project must support available technology
	on these platforms. We will make programs converting the
	format of the Tromsø project to formats appropriate for the
	different platforms and end user programs.</p>

	<p>As the work proceeds, we will publish test versions of the
	spellers. These will be made available on our web pages so
	that people interested may download them and test them.</p>
