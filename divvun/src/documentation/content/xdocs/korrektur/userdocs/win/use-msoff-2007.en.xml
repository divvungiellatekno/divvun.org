         <title>Use Divvun on Windows</title>
         <p>In order for the Divvun tools to be able to help you, you have to tell the computer that you actually do
         intend to write in Sami, by choosing Sami as the language of your text.</p>
         <p>1a. MS Office 2003: When you have opened MS Office you choose the menu <strong>Tools Languages Mark selected
         text as …</strong> <img alt="Menu to choose Sami" src="images/PC_14_Office_2003_velg_sprak.png" /></p>
         <p>1b. Office 2007: When you have opened MS Office you click the tab <strong>Se gjennom</strong> , where you
         chose <strong>Angi språk</strong></p>
         <p>2. In the emerging dialogue you choose <strong>Sami</strong> or <strong>Lule Sami</strong> . NB! Make sure
         that the box <strong>Identify language automatically</strong> is <em>not</em> ticked. If it <em>is</em> ticked,
         Office will guess the text is in languages other than Sami for a long time, and Divvun will not work as
         expected (most users report that it will eventually settle with the user's language setting, but that it takes
         time).</p>
         <p><img alt="Choose language dialogue" src="images/PC_15_Office_2003_bestem_sprak.png" /></p>
         <p>3. Now you may start to write in Sami, and the program will then help you with your spelling. You may either
         right-click (ctrl-click) on words underlined with red, in which case it looks as follows:<br /></p>
         <p><img alt="Suggestion in menu" src="images/PC_16_Bruke_stavekontrollen.png" /></p>
         <p>or you may start the speller in a separate window. Press the <img alt="abc-button"
         src="images/PC_17_abc_knapp.png" />. The result is:<br /><img alt="The spell checker in use"
