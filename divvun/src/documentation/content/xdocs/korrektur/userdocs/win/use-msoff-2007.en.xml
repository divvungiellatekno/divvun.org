			<title>Use Divvun on Windows</title>
			<p>In order for the Divvun tools to be able to help you, you have to
			tell the computer that you actually do intend to write in Sami, by
			choosing Sami as the language of your text.</p>

			<p>1. When you have opened MS Office you click the tab
			<strong>Se gjennom</strong>, where you choose <strong>Angi
			språk</strong><br/>
	 		<img src="images/off2007-select-language-nob.png"
	 		alt="Flik for å velge språk"/></p>

			<p>2. In the emerging dialogue you choose <strong>Sami</strong> or
			<strong>Lule Sami</strong> . NB! Make sure that the box
			<strong>Identify language automatically</strong> is <em>not</em>
			ticked. If it <em>is</em> ticked, Office will guess the text is in
			languages other than Sami for a long time, and Divvun will not work
			as expected (most users report that it will eventually settle with
			the user's language setting, but that it takes time).<br/>

			<p>3. Now you may start to write in Sami, and the program will then
			help you with your spelling. You may either right-click (ctrl-click)
			on words underlined with red, in which case it looks as follows:</p>

			<p>or you may start the speller in a separate window. Press the
			<img alt="abc-button" src="images/PC_17_abc_knapp.png" />. The
			result is:<br/>
